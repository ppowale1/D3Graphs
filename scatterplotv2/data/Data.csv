Watson Research Center ,Future high-performance computing systems require sub-2pJ/bit power efficien- cies at >10Gb/s [1-2]. The best reported optical link efficiencies at these data rates are ³2.5pJ/bit [1-4]. This paper describes two VCSEL-based multimode (MM) fiber optical links achieving sub-2pJ/bit power efficiency from 15Gb/s to 22Gb/s. The links realized in 90nm CMOS share the same TX but use two differ- ent RXs that explore different aspects of the power/BW/area tradeoff. ,"VCSEL-Based, 90nm CMOS",Optical,,1,,25,25,46,44.4,90.4,1840,1776,3600,390,,1.35,www.facebook.com

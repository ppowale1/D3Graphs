1997,8.1,NQ,SAR,1,"A MOSFET-only, 10 b, 200 ksample/s A/D converter capable of 12 b untrimmed linearity","The linearity of a successive approximation (SA) A/D converter is typically limited by its passive network. Published converters based on capacitive arrays or resistive ladders are limited to around 10 b if no trimming or calibration is used. Although static measurements show that MOS transistors are capable of excellent matching, few MOSFET-only converters achieved more than 10 b accuracy without self-calibration. This A/D converter adopts the current division ladder network based on MOSFETs. Extensive measurements on the MOSFET ladders with different resolutions and geometry establish the achievable linearity ","Hammerschmied, C.; Qiuting Huang", , ,2.155,,1.00E+05,56.5,,,,,56.5,1.20E-02,2.00E+05,1,2.00E+05,6.00E+04,,109339.8,,125.8,5.47E-01,178.76

Compared to other multi-stage ADC architectures, folding and interpolating ADCs are based on non-linear analog pre-processing. This architecture is an attractive solution for high-resolution ADCs, as extremely linear circuit topologies are not required. To increase the resolution of folding and interpolating ADCs above the published 8 b examples, without raising the number of parallel input stages or the number of comparators in the fine-comparator, a cascaded folding and interpolating architecture is introduced. The ADC achieves 64 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 75 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), while quantizing a 15 MHz full-scale input signal at 50 MSample/s.

A straight flash-architecture would need 1023 accurate fast comparators. With a 2 V input range, a comparator offset voltage of no more than 1 mV can be tolerated. Taking into account that the 1 mV is a 3-6 sigma value, leads to a large chip. If, however, the signals to the comparator are amplified before the critical decision, simple small comparators would suffice. To cope with the dynamic offset caused by the clocking and latch action of the comparator itself, the architecture must tolerate comparator offsets of up to 60-80 mV. Hence, a gain of at least 30 is necessary. A single amplifier however, could not handle this, as the input range of 2 V would be amplified to 60 V.

The ±0.25V input is amplified to ±1V and held in the track-and-hold circuit when the input clock rises. The 32 comparators in ADC1 produce an approximation that switches the 32 matched current sources in the main DAC. The residue is formed and amplified in the summer to ±0.5V and is converted by ADC2, an 8b folding-and-interpolating flash ADC. To allow low clock rates, there is no analog pipelining, and all analog settling from the track-to-hold transition to latching the result in ADC2 takes only 4.4ns.

In practice however, the SNR performance is usually severely degraded because of mismatches occurring in switched-capacitors (SC). This paper introduces a simple method to solve this problem. Regarding __ digital-to-analog converters (DAC), in addition to double-sampling, the accompanying use of internal decimation helps to relax the bandwidth requirements of the opamps.

Digitization of IF processing confers several important advantages, including greater reliability, potentially lower power consumption, and improved performance as technology scales. Unfortunately, as analog signal processing is eliminated and the A/D conversion is moved away from baseband, the signal that must be digitized has a larger dynamic range, and the converter must operate at a higher sampling rate. This work introduces a two-path, switched-capacitor architecture for a bandpass __ modulator that is suited to digitizing narrowband radio signals with large dynamic range. A fourth-order bandpass modulator is implemented in a standard 0.6 _m, single-poly, triple-metal CMOS process.

This allows the ADC to be moved closer to the receiver front end. Moving the digital interface closer to the antenna reduces receiver analog circuit complexity, eliminates DC-offset cancellation, inphase/quadrature (I/Q) gain calibration, dual I/Q mixers and improves system robustness as mixing is in the digital domain. This second-order bandpass __ modulator is targeted for an airborne radar system but is also expected to find use in a variety of communications applications. Measurements yield signal to noise+distortion ratio (SNR) from 92 dB (15 b) in narrowband ( 366 kHz) to 44 dB (7 b) in broadband (62.6 MHz) about a center frequency of 55.5 MHz.

This is extended to the quadrature, or complex, case if a complex filter - having complex-valued coefficients and thus not restricted to a symmetrical frequency response - is placed in a __ loop. The modulator performs a ÒcomplexÓ A/D conversion on the pair of analog inputs, that are in phase-quadrature, and it has two high-speed bit stream outputs: one represents the real output; the other the imaginary output. When combined, these outputs form a complex signal that accurately represents the complex input within a narrow frequency band. This quadrature modulator is useful in architectures for a single-chip digital-radio receiver. The receiver ideally has no image response, and thus the bulky narrow-band image-rejection filter in the RF stage of a single-path receiver can be replaced with a broadband one. The architecture alleviates many problems of the direct-conversion receiver, often considered for single-chip implementations, since the input signal is mixed to a non-zero IF where 1/f noise and DC offsets cause no problem and self-interference is not an issue because oscillator frequency is offset from the carrier frequency.

In contrast, multi-bit feedback stabilizes a higher-order DSM with little loss of dynamic range. As the internal signal swing is reduced with increase in number of feedback signal bits, the multi-bit DSM requires a lower slew rate and thus less power for analog circuits than the 1b case.

With a fully differential 1.5 b/stage architecture, the D/A subconverters can in principle be inherently linear, and the main limitation stems from the interstage gain accuracy. Besides the error caused by finite-op-amp gain and capacitor mismatch, the linear portion of the incomplete op-amp settling can also be modeled as an interstage gain error.

These converters have to combine the stringent speed specifications with the demand for low power consumption. Flash architectures are often chosen because they offer the largest speed. However, in this architecture, area and power depend exponentially on the resolution since the comparators are often the largest contributor to the overall power consumption. Folding is a well-known technique used to reduce the number of comparators in an ADC while maintaining high speed. It was previously implemented by generating a number of zero crossings with folding amplifiers, often in combination with interpolation or averaging. In this design, a folding factor of 2 is realized as in but with only dynamic power consumption and without using amplifiers. This reduces the number of comparators from 31 to 16 for a 5b resolution.","B. Verbruggen, J. Cranickx, M. Kuijk, P. Wambacq, G.

They also offer higher-frequency performance than SC modulators as no critical opamp settling is required. CT modulators with low OSR have achieved a DR greater than 75 dB in a 20 MHz band. However, they all suffer from inaccurate active filtering as filter time constants are set by RC and C/Gm values that vary by as much as plusmn20 to 30%. By lowering OSR, the signal band can be widened, but the in-band zero of the NTF should be optimally placed to maximize the DR. Inaccurate NTF zero either degrades the DR or makes the modulator unstable. This work presents an exact time-constant auto-tuning method using an LMS algorithm.

An extra phase is needed, but, surprisingly, there is no speed penalty when compared to a high-gain opamp solution because CLS does not require full settling during the next-to-last phase. In fact, the increased signal swing means that the same SNR can be achieved using smaller sampling capacitors. Thus, it could be argued that CLS can provide accurate results at a higher speed than using a traditional 2-phase operation with a high-gain opamp. For example, with CLS, the performance is maintained over the whole 0.9V supply, whereas a standard configuration has only a 0.6V swing. Thus, the standard configuration requires 2.25x larger sampling capacitors to achieve the same signal to kT/C noise ratio.","B. Gregoire, U-K.

The limitation of the classical folding architecture is the separate coarse channel to determine which fold an input signal is in. Higher-resolution ADCs benefit from a higher order of folding, which results in more closely spaced folds and makes the alignment between this ""fine"" channel and the ""coarse"" channel increasingly difficult due to offset and settling mismatch. In this paper we eliminate this separate coarse channel using instead a single ""unified"" set of cascaded folding stages, in which each folding stage acts as the coarse channel for the following folding stage. This extends previous work where the coarse channel is distributed and where the cascaded folding stages are pipelined.

Leveraging the VCO output phase directly precludes the need to span the entire nonlinear Kv characteristic since small perturbations (in the range of 10s of mV) at the tuning node are sufficient to shift the VCO phase by a substantial amount. Since an open-loop VCO is sensitive to frequency offsets and drift, and easily saturates its phase detector for large input signals, some form of negative feedback is necessary. Here, a multibit DAC subtracts the previously quantized phase value from the VCO input, creating a residue that is integrated during the next clock cycle. This feedback loop not only allows large signals to drive the VCO without incurring distortion from Kv nonlinearity, but also it is a 1s,-order CT DeltaSigma ADC loop, and it therefore 1s,-order shapes quantization noise.

2009,9.7,OS,SDCT,0.065,A 20MHz BW 68dB DR CT __ ADC Based on a Multi-Bit Time-Domain Quantizer and Feedback Element,"Low-power, small-area, 20 MHz-BW ADCs that can be integrated in nanoscale CMOS technologies are of immense interest to the wireless communication industry. Implementation of high-performance analog circuits in nanometric technologies faces several challenges. Time-domain digital signal processing (TDSP) can be used as an alternative for some analog circuits to overcome these challenges. The TDSP technique utilizes the high timing resolution available in nanoscale technologies, and can be implemented using digital circuits that are inherently less susceptible to noise. Circuits using this technique also become faster, smaller and consume less power with technology scaling. Hence, solutions using TDSP with as many digital circuits as possible are desired. An ADC architecture that uses a VCO-based time-domain quantizer is presented. This architecture uses a conventional feedback element (multi-element DAC with DEM) and 950 MHz sample rate that leads to high power consumption. In this work, a pulse-width modulator (PWM) and an all- digital time-to-digital converter (TDC) are used to implement the quantizer as well as the feedback element in the time domain. This approach achieves the necessary linearity in the feedback path without DEM or calibration, and allows a low output rate of 250 MS/S.","Vijay Dhanasekaran, Manisha Gambhir, Mohamed M.

2009,9.8,OS,SDSC,0.090,A Multirate 3.4-to-6.8mW 85-to-66dB DR GSM/Bluetooth/UMTS Cascade DT __M in 90nm Digital CMOS,"The main advantages of discrete-time (DT) systems are their robustness and their ability to exploit the high switching speeds of transistors in scaled technologies. Operating in discrete time also allows for system reconfiguration by changing the sampling frequency. Moreover, different sampling frequencies can be applied throughout a system. This multirate feature can then be exploited to trade performance for power and flexibility. The multirate technique can also be of benefit to discrete-time DeltaSigma modulators. In DeltaSigma modulators, the first integrators are the largest contributors to the overall power consumption since they set the overall noise and distortion of the modulator. The multirate technique can then be used to reduce the sampling speed of the first integrators and hence the power and compensate for loss in resolution by increasing the speed of the last integrators. However, multirate processing inside a single-loop DeltaSigma modulator introduces additional complexity due to the feedback from the last integrators to the input operating at a lower sampling frequency. This complexity can be avoided by using a cascaded architecture in which the sampling frequency is modified between the stages. It can be shown that a cascade DeltaSigma with the first loop operating at fs/2 and the second loop at 2fs is equivalent in terms of resolution to a cascade DeltaSigma with both loops operating at fs. Furthermore, a cascaded implementation can offer a power-efficient implementation in a multimode context by switching off the appropriate last stages . In this paper we present a 90 nm CMOStri-mode DT multirate cascade DeltaSigma modulator.","Lynn Bos, Gerd Vandersteen, Julien Ryckaert, Pieter Rombouts, Yves Rolain, Geert Van der Plas", , ,0.0756,,2.00E+06,65.0,,66.0,79.0,79.0,65.0,6.83E-03,3.20E+08,80,4.00E+06,1.71E+03,,1175.0,,149.7,2.94E-04,215.69

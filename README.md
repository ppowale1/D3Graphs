# D3Graphs

#Using D3.js, we have created two interactive charts graphing Optical Link and ADC performance data from the past 20 years. #Data for ADC's was obtained from Murmann's work at Stanford: http://web.stanford.edu/~murmann/adcsurvey.html . Data for #Optical Links was populated by hand from select research papers published in major conferences and journals.
